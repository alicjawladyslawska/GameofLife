## How to compile and run the program

The Java sources for the program are under *src/main/java/*.
The main class (Main.java) is in the root package.
It requires no external dependencies.

## Examples

There are three examples in the examples folder under the root directory.

## Running tests

The tests are under *src/test/java/*. They require JUnit 5.8.1 to run. The JUnit dependency is not included in the repository. [It can be found here.](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-engine)
