    <p>This example contains a pattern known as a <b>Pulsar</b>, on a 17x17 non-toroidal board.</p>
    <p>The pattern is a type of <b>oscillator</b> -  a pattern that is a predecessor of itself.</p>
    <p>The pulsar was found in March 1970 by Game of Life creator John Conway.</p>
    <p>Even though it is large, it is one of the most common oscillators.</p>
