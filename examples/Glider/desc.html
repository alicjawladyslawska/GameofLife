    <p>This example contains a pattern known as a <b>glider</b>, on a 10x5 toroidal board.</p>
    <p>The pattern is a type of <b>spaceship</b> - a pattern that travels across the board, eventually reappearing in a different position while maintaining its orientation.</p>
    <p>The glider is the smallest spaceship in the Game of Life, and was originally discovered in 1969 by mathematician Richard K. Guy.</p>
